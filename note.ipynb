Additionally, embedded systems are being used in satellites to collect and transmit data on weather patterns, climate change, and other environmental factors.

This is particularly important in sensitive areas such as airports, military bases, and other critical infrastructure, where unauthorized drone activity can pose a serious security threat.  \n",

Additionally, there is a need to ensure that these systems do not interfere with legitimate drone operations and respect privacy rights.  \n",

These videos can be used to deceive and manipulate video surveillance systems, leading to false alarms or missed threats, and potentially compromising public safety and security.  \n",

These technologies can help improve the reliability and accuracy of video surveillance systems and prevent false alarms or missed threats.

    "Pulse Width Modulation, or PWM, is a technique for getting analog results with digital means.\n",
    "Digital control is used to create a square wave, a signal switched between on and off. This on-off pattern can simulate voltages in between the full Vcc of the board (e.g., 5 V on UNO, 3.3 V on a MKR board) and off (0 Volts) by changing the portion of the time the signal spends on versus the time that the signal spends off. The duration of \"on time\" is called the pulse width. To get varying analog values, you change, or modulate, that pulse width. If you repeat this on-off pattern fast enough with an LED for example, the result is as if the signal is a steady voltage between 0 and Vcc controlling the brightness of the LED.  \n",
    "Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) uses digital signals to control power applications, as well as being fairly easy to convert back to analog with a minimum of hardware.  \n",
    "PWM can have many of the characteristics of an analog control system, in that the digital signal can be free wheeling.\n",
    "PWM does not have to capture data, although there are exceptions to this with higher end controllers.  \n",
    "The reason PWM is popular is simple. Many loads, such as resistors, integrate the power into a number matching the percentage of duty cycle. Conversion into its analog equivalent value is straightforward.\n",
    "LEDs are very nonlinear in their response to current, give an LED half its rated current and you still get more than half the light the LED can produce. With PWM the light level produced by the LED is very linear.\n",
    "Motors are also very responsive to PWM.  \n",
    "One of several ways PWM can be produced is by using a sawtooth waveform and a comparator. The sawtooth (or triangle wave) need not be symmetrical, but the linearity of the waveform is important. The frequency of the sawtooth waveform is the sampling rate for the signal.  \n",
    "If there isn’t any computation involved PWM can be fast. The limiting factor is the comparators frequency response. This may not be an issue since quite a few of the uses are fairly low speed. Some microcontrollers have PWM built in and can record or create signals on demand.  \n",
    "Uses for PWM vary widely. It is the heart of Class D audio amplifiers, by increasing the voltages you increase the maximum output, and by selecting a frequency beyond human hearing (typically 44Khz) PWM can be used. The speakers do not respond to the high frequency but duplicate the low frequency, which is the audio signal. Higher sampling rates can be used for even better fidelity, and 100Khz or much higher is not unheard of.  \n",
    "Another popular application is motor speed control. Motors as a class require very high currents to operate. Being able to vary their speed with PWM, increases the efficiency of the total system by quite a bit. PWM is more effective at controlling motor speeds at low RPM than linear methods."

    "Pulse width modulation (PWM) is a modulation technique that generates variable-width pulses to represent the amplitude of n analog input signal. The output switching transistor is on more of the time for a high-amplitude signal and off more of the time for a low-amplitude signal. The digital nature (fully on or off) of the PWM circuit is less costly to fabricate than an analog circuit that does not drift over time.  \n",
    "PWM is widely used in ROV applications to control the speed of a DC motor and/or the brightness of a lightbulb. For example, if the line were closed for 1 μs, opened for 1 μs, and continuously repeated, the target would receive an average of 50% of the voltage and run at half speed or the bulb at half brightness. If the line were closed for 1 μs and open for 3 μs, the target would receive an average of 25%."
